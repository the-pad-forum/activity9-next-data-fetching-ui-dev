# Activity 9 - Next Data Fetching UI Dev

**Deadline for Completion:** Friday, 29th December 2023 @ 11:59 PM GMT

## Overview
This project demonstrates basic data fetching from a REST API and displays the data in a user-friendly interface. It uses Next.js with TypeScript and incorporates Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI for styling. The data from three endpoints (`posts`, `users`, `albums`) is formatted into distinct UI elements - a paragraph, a table, and a 3-column grid card.

## Objective
To build a Next.js demo application that:
- Fetches data from specified API endpoints.
- Formats and displays the data in different UI components.
- Ensures code readability and maintainability.
